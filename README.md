# Front End Practice

This is a compliation of all my (somewhat) polished practice I've done while learning HTML, CSS and JS. 
Some of the pages are recreations of actual websites while other (mostly the ones involving JS) are designed by myself.
If you want some insight on each of the pages like what skills were used/learned be sure to check the lisy below or the README's
in each seperate project within the lib folder.

# Pages and Insights

(Preface: I am writing some of these comments years after I actually created the page so the insights aren't exactly from the moment
I finished each project. I have some old README docs from when I last committed to some but they are not very thorough. This mostly applies to 
the first 5 in the list.)

1. **[Google Search Page](/lib/google-homepage) - Based off [TOP Google Homepage Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css)**   
  This was the first "large scale" project I attempted. Before this I was mostly learning sytax and doing isolated front end practice. From this project I learned
  how to compile all my previous small scale practice and how to layout html to create a design. Probably the biggest lesson I learned was about centering
  something (in this case the logo and search bar). The way I implemented this at the time auto margins and absolute positions. If it were to change it now
  I would probably use flexbox to center items and reduce my css file space. This was also my first real use of git and github as a version control. It learned the basics
  of git and how to use version control to my advantage.
  
2. **[Sketchboard](/lib/sketchboard) - Based off [TOP Etch-A-Sketch Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)**  
  From what I recall, this was a difficult jump from my previous projects. Before this I was mostly using only HTML and CSS and had just learned the basics of JS.
  This project required DOM (Document Object Model) maniplulation in order to change each block's colour as the mouse passed over it. Basically whenever the mouse passed
  over an individual block it would update the class with a coloured in background colour. The HTML and CSS was fairly straightfoward but again required centering.
  
3. **[Calculator](/lib/calculator) - Based off [TOP Calculator Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator)**  
  Again the HTML and CSS is fairly straightforward with most of the work being the centering and designing of the calculator. The real meat of the project was making
  implementing the operations you'd expect from a calculator with JS and then connecting each of the "buttons" to the script and making the calculator function.
  The most difficult part was making sure that the equations would follow the order of operations so stringing an equation together would result in the correct answer.
  There is also a lot of errors that can arise due to imperfect user interaction which had to be kept in mind and fixes needed to be implemented. For example, a user
  should not be able to have two operators right next to each other (ex 5++3). There still remains some errors to be cleaned up and I planned to implement keyboard
  support but I had already spent a lot of time on this project and thought it would be more worth my time to move onto newer things.
