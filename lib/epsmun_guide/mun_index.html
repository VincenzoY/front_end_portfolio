        <h1><u>A Concise Introduction to MUN</u></h1>
        <p>Welcome to A Concise Introduction to Model UN. As this is supposed to be 
            brief, feel free to skip this introduction and get right into the guide, 
            you won’t miss much. The reason I wrote this guide is because I always 
            found beginners information towards MUN was either packed with unnecessary 
            information or a page of 50 links that you have to parse through to get any 
            sort of idea of what to do. I saw a problem so I decided to fix it by drafting 
            a guide of everything I wish I knew before starting out in as few words as 
            possible. Hopefully by the end of reading this you’ll feel confident going 
            into your first committee.</p>
