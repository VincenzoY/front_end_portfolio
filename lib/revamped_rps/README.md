# revamped_rps
A revamped version of my previous rock paper scissors game. This time it uses javascript's DOM to allow for the website to take inputs of the page. In this case it's icons that you choose to make your move.

Live version can be found [here](https://vincenzoy.github.io/front_end_portfolio/lib/revamped_rps/rps_index.html).
